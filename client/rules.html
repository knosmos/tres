                <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
                <h3>To be the first player to play all of the cards in their hand</h3>
                <h2>SETUP</h2>
                <h3>Each player is dealt seven cards at the start of the game.</h3>
                <h2>GAMEPLAY</h2>
                <h3>On their turn, a player may play a card from their hand, or draw a
                card from the deck. A played card must have the same number/symbol or color as the
                card currently at the top of the discard pile. Multiple cards may be played
                in the same turn, but they must have the same number/symbol. The implemented
                "Special cards" (Reverse, Cancel, +2, Wild) function identically to regular Uno.</h3>
